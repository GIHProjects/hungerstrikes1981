      <p>"Just what did the voters of Northern Ireland mean by electing an imprisoned 
        nationalist guerilla to the British Parliament? To some, the victory of 
        Robert Sands constitutes an endorsement of the Irish Republican Army and 
        its bloody ways. Some bitter-enders may even hope, ghoulishly, that Mr. 
        Sands will persist to the death in his 53-day prison hunger strike. But 
        his death would be a tragedy serving no purpose, and to view his election 
        as a mandate for violence is a shallow distortion." <br>
        &nbsp;<span class="title">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Prisoner Sands, Member 
        of Parilament" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> New York Times,</i> 22 April 1981, 26:1 
        </span> </p>
      <p>&quot;Bobby Sands' use of the non-violent tactic of the hunger strike 
        has been far more successful in evoking public interest and support than 
        is deserved. It has won him election, while in prison in Belfast, to the 
        British parliament. It has made him a hero to supporters of Irish unification 
        on both sides of the Atlantic... </p>
      <p>Mahatma Gandhi used the hunger strike to move his countrymen to abstain 
        from fratricide. Bobby Sands' deliberate slow suicide is intended to precipitate 
        civil war. The former deserved veneration and influence. The latter would 
        be viewed, in a reasonable world, not as a charismatic martyr but as a 
        fanatical suicide, whose regrettable death provides no sufficient occasion 
        for killing others.&quot; <br>
        <span class="title">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bobby Sands and Mahatma 
        Gandhi" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Chicago Tribune,</i> 28 April 1981, 
        1-15 </span></p>
      <p>"On the question of principle, Britain's prime minister Thatcher is right 
        in refusing to yield political status to Bobby Sands, the Irish Republican 
        Army hunger striker. But this dying young man has made it appear that 
        her stubbornness, rather than his own, is the source of a fearful conflict 
        already ravaging Northern Ireland. For that, Mrs. Thatcher is partly to 
        blame. By appearing unfeeling and unresponsive, she and her Government 
        are providing Bobby Sands with a death-bed gift-the crown of martyrdom."<br>
        <span class="title">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Britain's Gift to 
        Bobby Sands" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> New York Times,</i> 29 April 1981, 
        26:1 </span> </p>
      <p>"The death of Bobby Sands, a self-starved prisoner in Belfast, can be 
        expected to have consequences for many in Northern Ireland. Why has he 
        not been kept alive by forced feeding?...If forced feeding could deny 
        Irish nationalists the incendiary martyrdom they seek, why has the United 
        Kingdom government not used it?" <br>
        <span class="title">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bobby Sands' fast"<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Chicago Tribune, </i>30 April 1981, 
        1-15-2-E </span></p>
      <p><a name="saga"></a>"As they did with Kevin Barry, executed at 18 by the 
        British in 1920, poets will write sad songs of Bobby Sands, filling American 
        saloons with late-night tears and beers...Ireland does not need more sad 
        songs. Ireland does not need more martyrs. The slow suicide attempt of 
        Bobby Sands has cast his land and his cause into another downward spiral 
        of death and despair. There are no heroes in the saga of Bobby Sands." 
        <br>
        <span class="title">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Saga of Bobby 
        Sands" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Boston Globe,</i> 3 May 1981, 
        A6 </span></p>
      <p>"Sands' decision to seek martyrdom and the decision of some other imprisoned 
        IRA guerillas to also become hunger strikers constitute a test of will 
        between the outlawed IRA and the British government which is now working 
        cooperatively with the Republic of Ireland to seek alleviation of the 
        Ulster problem. And some observers see the hunger strikes as a deliberate 
        attempt to raise tensions throughout Ireland and thus prevent meaningful 
        progress in these talks... </p>
      <p>The demands appear harmless enough, perhaps even trivial. And many view 
        the British government's response as heartless and inhumane. That government, 
        however, would have been in the position of admitting to the world that 
        it held prisoners because of their political beliefs and not because they 
        had violated criminal statutes. </p>
      <p>Terrorism goes far beyond the expression of political belief. And dealing 
        with it does not allow for compromise as many countries of Western Europe 
        and United States have learned. The bombing of bars, hotels, restaurants, 
        robbing of banks, abductions and killings of prominent figures are all 
        criminal acts and must be dealt with by criminal law." <br>
        <span class="title">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Death of Bobby 
        Sands" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>San Francisco Chronicle,</i> 6 
        May 1981</span></p>
      <p>"With the technical balance of power in the Dail resting with six independents 
        - "highly individualistic," one commentator calls them - it may be at 
        least a week before Haughey or rival Fine Gael leader Garret Fitzgerald 
        can form a government. The emotional balance of power, however, is likely 
        to rest with Paddy Agnew and Kieran Doherty. The two H-Block prisoners 
        will not be able to take their seats in the Dail, but their brooding absence 
        - and the 10 percent of the overall vote which they and seven other IRA 
        prisoners received - is certain to force a change in Ireland's policy 
        toward the hunger strikers and toward the entire Ulster question." <br>
        <span class="title">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "…And the H-Blocks 
        pull" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Boston Globe, </i>16 June 1981, 
        14 </span></p>
      <p>"Gunmen, either in or out of prison, cannot resolve the Northern Ireland 
        problem. Yet the British government has to recognize more clearly than 
        it has yet done that the hunger strikers have temporarily seized the propaganda 
        and psychological initiative. Until the furies of the hunger strikers 
        are dissipated or attention deflected from them by constructive political 
        action, the hope for any peaceful progress in the North is going to be 
        further damaged." <br>
        &nbsp;<span class="title">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ireland's New Leader"<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Boston Globe,</i> 2 July 1981, 
        10</span></p>
      <p>"The hunger strike has ended, and as all the world knows, it has ended 
        in a tremendous victory for the Irish people…Ten young Irishmen have made 
        the world aware that the Irish people still fight and die to free their 
        country. Seven months ago the British told the world that Irish Republicans 
        have no popular support. The world then saw dying men elected to both 
        the Westminster and Dublin Parliament and tens of thousands walked behind 
        them to their graves. The British said these men were criminals and the 
        world saw ten men die for the freedom of their country-a death which no 
        criminal ever died. The British claimed that the British presence in Ireland 
        is legitimate and the world saw that British rule was itself the criminal 
        element in Ireland. Seven months ago, the news reporters spoke of 'Irish 
        terrorists' and now they speak of Irish nationalists fighting to end British 
        rule. Even the Anglophilic <i>New York Times</i> listed international 
        support, financial support from America and numbers of British people 
        demanding British withdrawal as accomplishments of the hunger strikers.&quot; 
        <br>
        <span class="title">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hunger Strike Victory" 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Irish People, </i>10 October 1981, 
        4 </span></p>
      <p>&quot; …the government in London should learn from the strike that the 
        problems of Ulster will not go away by being ignored. Until Prime Minister 
        Margaret Thatcher recognizes the need for persistent and concentrated 
        statemanship in Northern Ireland, nothing will be accomplished other than 
        more of the military-oriented stopgaps that have done nothing so far but 
        keep a kind of leaky lid on the explosive province. Until the two main 
        communities are brought together in a consensual arrangement of self-government, 
        the extremists of both sides will be able to use everything from terror 
        to hunger strikes to keep tensions high.&quot; <br>
