      <p>"Only the the loud voice of the Irish Republic and world opinion can 
        bring them [the British government] to their senses and only a hunger 
        strike, where lives are laid down as proof of the strength of our political 
        convictions, can rally such opinion, and present the British with the 
        problem that far from criminalising the cause of Ireland their intransigence 
        is actually bringing popular attention to that cause." <br>
        <span class="title">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IRA Blanketmen statement 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Irish People,</i> 14 March 1981, 1 </span></p>
      <p>"The magazine section of <i>The New York Times</i> of Sunday, March 1st 
        contained an article on terrorism. Its basic theme was that there is an 
        international network of terrorist organizations supported and trained 
        directly or indirectly by the Soviet Union for 'the destabilization of 
        Western democratic society.' One organization singled out for particular 
        attention was the 'Provisional' Irish Republican Army. References to the 
        situation in Ireland were clearly designed for anti-Irish propaganda in 
        America: the errors and untruths would be too obvious to Irish readers. 
        Throughout the article there was a deliberate effort to assign to the 
        anti-Marxist Provisional IRA the views and activities of the pro-Marxist 
        'Officials.'" <br>

      <p>"Since the start of Sands' self-starvation,<i> The New York Times</i> 
        and <i>The Washington Post</i> have explained Sands' imprisonment only 
        in terms of convictions for 'illegal possession of guns.' That may be 
        technically accurate; it is not informative. Although it taints the melodrama, 
        it is well to remember that Sands is a terrorist." <br>

      <p>"The mini-invasion of foreign journalists attracted by the threat of 
        bloody rioting came in for stern criticism by the Protestant minister 
        who buried Gary Martin, a police constable killed by a bomb planted in 
        a booby-trapped truck Monday… 'The world's press,' said Rev. Donald Watts, 
        '…may be fascinated for a time by those able to manipulate it for their 
        own ends and by those who fly in and out of the province to make easy, 
        facile statements.'" <br>

      <p> "I'm a bit cynical about the international press. It only comes here 
        when there is a smell of blood, not when the patient work is being done. 
        All this international attention gives the Provos [outlawed Provisional 
        Irish Republican Army members] a big lift. People get on bandwagons."

      <p>"If over the next few weeks or months there are acts of terrorism against 
        British officials in America, a deal of responsibility will rest with 
        the disgraceful and unbalanced coverage the U.S. media - especially TV 
        - have given to the death of Bobby Sands. In all the outpouring of indignation 
        and emotion, the American media have given nearly exclusive coverage to 
        pro- I.R.A. spokesmen. Not a word has been heard from the many moderate 
        critics of the I.R.A. The Rev. Ian Paisley, the Ulster extremist who is 
        an apologist for Ulster vigilantism and the terrorism of the other side, 
        has been portrayed as somehow representative of critics of the I.R.A. 
        This grotesque picture is sheer I.R.A. propaganda." <br>
        &nbsp;<span class="title">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter Samuel, Letter 
        to the Editor<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>New York Times, </i>7 May 1981, 
        34 </span></p>
      <p>"Saying 'I stick by my story,' a New York <i>Daily News</i> columnist 
        resigned Friday after the British army in Northern Ireland charged that 
        an article he wrote about the riots after the death of Bobby Sands was 
        a 'complete fabrication.' </p>
      <p>Michael Daly, 29, had come under attack earlier in the day when the London 
        <i>Daily Mail</i> charged that his story was 'a pack of lies.'… </p>
      <p>The <i>Mail</i> said Daly's article from Belfast was 'a malevolent piece 
        of lying propaganda.' It accused the United States news media in general 
        and the <i>Daily News</i> in particular of 'spearheading a campaign to 
        persuade American politicians to take an increasingly anti-British line….'" 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="title">&nbsp;<i>Chicago Tribune,</i> 
        9 May 1981, W1-4-2</span></p>
      <p>"…a chorus of our politicians and prelates implored British Prime Minister 
        Margaret Thatcher to legitimize Sands, who finally killed himself by starvation, 
        and his murderous friends as 'political prisoners.' ... Cardinal Terence 
        Cooke of New York begged Thatcher to give special treatment to Sands and 
        his army of Lee Harvey Oswalds. </p>
      <p>When you can get a cardinal to hedge on murder, you have wrought a propaganda 
        triumph. </p>
      <p>The IRA has done it. They have snookered not only the cardinal [Terence 
        Cooke of New York] and much of the American news media, but nearly all 
        Irish-American Catholics into backing their ostensible cause of 'Brits 
        out for a reunited Ireland.'...It is an organization with no enemies on 
        the Left. </p>
      <p>The upshot is most IRA true believers in America have been had. They're 
        too terrified to set a shoe in Ulster, or to look at the other side of 
        the coin. They swallow IRA propaganda as if it were taffy. The Irish war 
        will fade in direct proportion to the Irish-American's willingness to 
        challenge the IRA's line, to hear the British side, and to realize, one 
        hopes, what the IRA is: less than 500 Oswald-Hinckley freaks, supplied 
        with Soviet bloc weapons, intent on turning both Irelands into an Allende-type 
        Chile. There isn't a patriot among them." <br>

      <p>"Authorities have complained that some foreign television crews and photographers 
        have encouraged rioters by offering money, candy or just the inducement 
        of having one's picture recorded sending a rock or a firebomb in the direction 
        of a soldier, policeman or armored car." <br>

      <p> "I don't think they are being willfully obscurantist about Northern 
        Ireland. When they deal with Ireland, certain stereotypes come into play. 
        It's hard to break through them: the stereotype of the British as being 
        unquestionably fair, the image of the British as 'the honest bobby' who's 
        doing his best to keep the two savage, anachronistic groups in Northern 
        Ireland apart… </p>
      <p>And then you have, on the other side of that, the image of the irrational 
        Irish: colorful, a bit rustic, unpredictable. That stereotype, too, tends 
        to restrict coverage." <br>
        <span class="title">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jack Holland, 
        journalist, when asked what he thought of the American media's <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coverage of the Troubles <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Seeing Both Orange and Green," by Colman 
        McCarthy<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Washington Post,</i> 23 May 1981, 
        A15 </span></p>
      <p>"I remember when I first heard of the Hunger Strike and the Blanket Prisoners 
        in Northern Ireland. I didn't fully understand what the whole thing was 
        about. One reason for that was because the news media had so little coverage 
        of the whole situation in the Maze Prison and on Northern Ireland. It 
        wasn't until Bobby Sands was elected to British Parliament while starving 
        himself to death in prison, the news media took notice, and I finally 
        began to absorb what was actually happening, I realized that he must be 
        committed to a real cause… </p>
      <p>I commend the certain members of the American news media who are finally 
        sending reporters into the north of Ireland and giving full accounts of 
        the conditions there, and not just reports from the British News Agency. 
        It took Bobby Sands' death to bring this about. Of course, there are still 
        papers and TV stations who still report one-sided news in favor of Britain. 
        The IRA was painted as an underground terrorist organization who wanted 
        only to kill innocent people. In this day and age when we can broadcast 
        from outer space, why are we so ignorant of the history and background 
        of why the IRA is still fighting?&quot;<br>
