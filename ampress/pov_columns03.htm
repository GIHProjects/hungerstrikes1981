      <h1>Columns: June - July</h1>
      <p><a name="mccabe01"></a>&quot;I am only slightly less puzzled by the American 
        reaction to the death of Bobby Sands. It is reliably reported that American 
        dollars, recently almost a trickle, are going to the IRA in large amounts 
        since the death of Bobby Sands. </p>
      <p>Do American contributors to the IRA know that their money almost certainly 
        goes to buy Kalashnikov rifles and other weapons from Eastern Europe? 
        Do they know that the IRA is an organization deplored by no leftist or 
        terrorist organization in Europe or Asia? Do they know that Moscow praised 
        Bobby Sands as a martyred freedom fighter? Do they know that this terrorist 
        organization is not supported by the Republic of Ireland or the vast majority 
        of Catholics in the North? </p>
      <p>I have said many times that the problem of Irish unification is an insoluble 
        one, and this I still believe...And the suicides of Bobby Sands and the 
        others who are choosing to die by starvation, I firmly believe, have put 
        that solution backward by at least a decade." <br>

      <p><a name="campbell01"></a>&quot;Mrs. Thatcher seems to have become increasingly 
        nervous as hunger striker Joe McDonnell nears death and she is concerned 
        that the uproar among Irish-Americans will be greater this time than it 
        was when Bobby Sands died. One of the main objectives of her government 
        is to persuade Irish-America that the British are not the tyrants that 
        many people over here think they are." <br>

      <p><a name="smith01"></a>"The whole sad affair in Ireland is something the average person cannot 
        comprehend. At an age when most American boys thought a really major disaster 
        was a pimple on the nose the night of the prom, the Irish lads were already 
        seasoned fighters. These boys sucked up hatred and rebellion with their 
        mother's milk. It's a way of life to them. </p>
      <p>Other terrorist groups have committed horrible crimes in Northern Ireland, 
        but none has sold itself so successfully on this side of the Atlantic 
        as the Provisionals...</p>
      <p>The current hunger strike is a last-ditch survival attempt by the IRA, 
        whose capacity for direct action has dwindled during the past nine years... 
      </p>
      <p>The cold reality is that the Provos are a small band of violent murderers. 
        They have abused a fine and honorable tradition to exploit the honest 
        emotions of Irish Americans. Their misguided idealism does not change 
        the facts. They are not freedom fighters. They do not speak for the vast 
        majority of the Irish people. They are not the legitimate heirs of the 
        original IRA who fought to push the British out of the south of Ireland 
        60 years ago...</p>
      <p>Stripped of its tawdry veils of romance, the hunger strike is a pathetic 
        and hypocritical irrelevance that can only perpetuate and increase the 
        violence here however the government responds." <br>
        <span class="title">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unmasking the IRA" 
        by Bill Smith <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>San Francisco Chronicle,</i> 7 
        July 1981, A1-1-P </span></p>
      <p><a name="murphy01"></a>"But the troubles in Northern Ireland have long 
        since diluted any feeling on my part concerning beauty in Northern Ireland. 
        Belfast to me is a gray and cheerless city, and I remember Derry's downtown 
        section as being almost devastated by bombs and fire. Mutual hatred between 
        Protestants and Catholics is almost a tangible quality in Northern Ireland 
        and has been for longer than anyone can remember. </p>
      <p>However, something significant has changed in Northern Ireland - but 
        at a terrible price. Six IRA members have starved themselves to death 
        in their unsuccessful campaign to gain political status for prisoners.</p>
      <p>But something changed when Bobby Sands died, because "murderers and thugs" 
        do not normally starve themselves to death to support a cause. Five more 
        young men, all IRA members, followed Sands' example and died for a cause 
        they obviously feel is worth their very lives. </p>
      <p>They have become martyrs on a troubled and bloody island that has honored 
        martyrs for longer than anyone can remember. Much longer. But perhaps 
        more significant is that the six dead young men have given the IRA a degree 
        of legitimacy despite the Catholic Church's traditional opposition, and 
        have focused some world attention on the apparent fact the IRA has more 
        support on the Catholic side of the barricades than previously believed."

        beauty" by Jeremiah V. Murphy<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Boston Globe,</i> 13 July 1981, 
        13</span> </p>
      <p><a name="kelly01"></a>&quot;Mrs. Thatcher has made it clear from the 
        outset that she will not yield to 'terrorism' and the British regard the 
        hunger strike weapon as just one more in the arsenal of the IRA. </p>
      <p>In fairness it must be said that there are many Irish north and south 
        of the Border who share the same viewpoint. </p>
      <p>However, the point is not really that the hunger strikers may or may 
        not be terrorists. The point is that they do not see themselves as such. 
        They see themselves as irregular soldiers captured in the conduct of a 
        guerilla war-and a war that was declared as such by no less a personage 
        than the commanding officer of the British Army in the North. </p>
      <p>They also regard themselves as the legitimate heirs of the republican 
        tradition, fighters for the right of all of the Irish people to independence 
        and sovereignty, a right which the total electorate overwhelmingly endorsed 
        on the only occasion the British allowed them to opt to show a mandate.&quot;

      <p><a name="mcgrory01"></a>"Let flames lick England's cities, let England's 
        last colony dance with death, the prime minister clings to her principled 
        inflexibilities-and blames others for the mess. </p>
      <p>Possible the queen could convince the unyielding prime minister that 
        stopping the hunger strikes would be a victory for England-and for her, 
        and that a halt would be a sensible security measure for the royal wedding 
        day." <br>

        Iron Woman" by Mary McGrory <br>

        N1-7-1-C </span></p>
      <p><a name="mor01"></a>&quot;The mounting toll of hunger strike murders 
        continues. For us in New York, suffering through an unexpected July heat 
        wave, the murders only make the oppressive dog days and nights seem longer. 
        The British murder machine is back in high gear, as Thatcher's intransigence 
        depends together with the resolve of the hunger strikers. The high hopes 
        engendered by the delegation of clergy who visited the men engaged in 
        the life and death struggle turns out to be another ploy of the British 
        government to try to discredit the protestors as the eleventh hour approached. 
        There would be no concessions but it was worth milking the situation for 
        all it was worth. Anything to try and convince the world and blistering 
        Britain that these people want to die, and there is nothing that her majesty's 
        government can do with people who are intent on taking their own lives. 
        I'll give them this, they are consistent, and have been since before the 
        Treaty of Limerick, when they deal with the Irish.&quot; <br>
