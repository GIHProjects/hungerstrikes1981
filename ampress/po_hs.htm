      <p><a name="sandsb"></a>"We wish to state publicly that we have made genuine 
        attempts to resolve the prison protest but have been exasperated and frustrated 
        by the British administration. We have endured four and a half years of 
        the blanket protest and were forced to escalate it when all else failed. 
        We will not crawl now." <br>
        &nbsp;<span class="title">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bobby Sands, officer 
        commanding of the H-Block IRA prisoners in Long Kesh/Maze Prison <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Irish People,</i> 31 January 1981, 2 
        </span> </p>
      <p>"We, the republican political prisoners...having waited patiently for 
        seven weeks for evidence that the British government was prepared to resolve 
        the prison crisis, and having given them every available opportunity to 
        do so, declare our intention of hunger striking once more..." <br>
        <span class="title">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IRA Blanketmen statement<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, 6 February, 1981, 1-12-1 
        </span></p>
      <p>"It needs to be asked openly of the Irish Bishops, of Cardinal O'Fiaich 
        and of politicans like John Hume, what did your recommending ending of 
        the last hunger-strike gain for us? </p>
      <p>Where is the peace in the prisons which like a promise was held before 
        dying men's eyes? And who but the Brits are responsible for our state 
        which is far worse today than it ever was? </p>
      <p>We the blanketmen, and we the women political prisoners in Armagh, have 
        had enough of British deceit and of broken promises. Hunger-strikes to 
        the death if necessary will begin commencing March 1st, 1981, the fifth 
        anniversary of the withdrawal of political status in the H-Blocks and 
        in Armagh jail. We are demanding to be treated as political prisioners 
        which everyone recognizes we are. </p>
      <p>We call upon all those who supported us during the last hunger-strike 
        to again rally to our cause and we call upon those who sat on the fence 
        to now see the intransigence of the British and the justness of our cause."<br>

      <p>"We, the parents, brothers and sisters of Francis Hughes, murdered by 
        the British government, wish to protest in the strongest possible way 
        at the manner in which Francis' body was hijacked by the RUC, who were 
        obviously acting on the orders of their political masters. We totally 
        reject the RUC statement and explanation for the disgraceful way they 
        treated us and our dead brother. We wished only to bury him in peace and 
        in a manner befitting his death. Are we to be deprived even of this simple 
        and reasonable request?&quot;<br>
        &nbsp;<span class="title">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statement of the family 
        of Francis Hughes <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Irish People,</i> May 30 1981, 2 </span></p>
      <p>"From Monday, June 8th, 1981, we the Republican political prisoners in 
        the H-Blocks, Long Kesh, will be escalating the hunger strike. The escalation 
        will take the form of more Republican prisoners going on hunger strike 
        and they will be phased onto the hunger strike over a matter of weeks. 
      </p>
      <p>We feel that this escalation is necessary because the existing 4-man 
        relay strategy allows the British a recuperation period during which they 
        can enjoy a lessening of pressure and can callously prepare for the deaths 
        of the next hunger strikers. The escalation will ensure that no respite 
        occurs." <br>

      <p>"Comrades of ours have died and eight of our other comrades presently 
        face death on hunger strike. Our people on the outside have died, and 
        more may die. That is why we seek immediate talks...it is a reasonable 
        request." <br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, 5 July 1981, 
        A-1-5</span></p>
      <p>"Our position has not and will not alter up to such a time as the British 
        government decides to honorably settle the issue. [We urge Catholic Church 
        leaders and the Irish government] to spend their time pressuring the British 
        - not us." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="title">Prisoners statement regarding 
        the settlement negotiated by the Red Cross <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Washington Post</i>, 1 August 1981, A18 </span></p>
      <p>"We, the family of hunger striker Paddy Quinn, wish to clarify our position 
        on recent events…</p>
      <p> Paddy was unconscious due to several epileptic attacks which were caused 
        by a shortage of oxygen to the brain. He was obviously in immense pain 
        and was screaming and kicking. His mother was unable to bear the sight 
        of him enduring such suffering and asked the doctors to save him. </p>
      <p>We would like to utterly condemn the media suggestion that other hunger 
        strikers' families should have acted and should still act in the way that 
        ours did. One must remember that had Paddy been conscious, we could not 
        have taken the decision to give him medical treatment. He was determined 
        to go on to the end. </p>
      <p>The brave men remaining on hunger strike are conscious and while they 
        remain so only they can make the decision to end the hunger strike. </p>
      <p>We wish to stress that we are 100% behind the prisoners' five just demands 
        and call on everyone of influence to put pressure on the British government 
        to end their cruelty and settle the prison dispute. </p>
      <p>We feel that the British government should give the already conforming 
        prisoners what they intend to give the protesting prisoners if the protest 
        ends." <br>

      <p>"There is nothing that any human being values more than life. Every man 
        clings to it with every once of strength of his being. To willingly surrender 
        it is acknowledged as the greatest sacrifice any man can make. </p>
      <p>Not only to die, but to choose a death which is slow and agonizing, further 
        serves to illustrate the depths of courage and sincerity amongst the men 
        in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh. What it takes to willingly undergo this 
        ordeal, willingly undergo suffering, none of us can possibly imagine. 
      </p>
      <p>As each day passes, the death shadow of the shroud descends ominously 
        on each of these brave Irishmen and it has done oft times before… </p>
