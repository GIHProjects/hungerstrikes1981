      <p><a name="hinckle01"></a>&quot;I asked him [Noel Cassidy, former IRA blanketman] 
        what it was like, and how it could be so bad that 420 men could allow 
        Sands, the best and brightest of their young lot, the Hon. Member of Parliament 
        for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, to shrivel up like a turnip. </p>
      <p>He told me. There was the sun of the Easter Rising in his eyes. There 
        was also a feeling of grief and horror and a sense of sorrow agreed upon...</p>
      <p>He told a tale of duplicity and Indian-giving that led to the current 
        gruesome crisis. In the Maze, rapists who have been described by representatives 
        of the Crown as Ordinary Decent Criminals are allowed to play sports while 
        Irish Republican prisoners lie naked in cells with walls smeared with 
        excrement. The British say this is the stubborn rebels' punishment for 
        not admitting they are your regular crooks, as in the Mafia.&quot;<br>

      <p><a name="nyhan01"></a>"Bobby Sands had a right to do what he wanted with 
        whatever life was left in him. But…you had to wonder if the 27-year-old 
        IRA man has done the right thing…If they've got too much of anything in 
        this tiny green-hill country, they've got too many dead heroes. What they 
        lack is enough live politicians with the gumption to reach out beyond 
        their own narrow religious or political constituencies to fold in some 
        support from the other side." <br>

      <p><a name="omalley01"></a>"It is often said there is too much history in 
        Ireland. But there is no history now, just lies, distortion, and sham. 
        And it is to this that the sad and awful death of Bobby Sands will add. 
        He is myth now, part of an elaborately cultivated contrivance to conceal 
        an ugliness about ourselves we dare not face: It is the Irish who are 
        doing the damage to the Irish. We are our own oppressors. </p>
      <p>We have, of course, constructed ingenious strategems to evade the truth, 
        even to the point of denying who we are, of denying the past. We have, 
        instead, a set of myths, an idea about Ireland that satisfies our need 
        to sublimate the past, that compensates for the harsh, uncomforting reality 
        of what we have done to each other in the name of God, and in the name 
        of country. </p>

      <p>All of history is viewed through the prism of the Easter Uprising of 
        1916. It is refracted. What does not fit the myth of enduring struggle 
        against the British oppressor is discarded. What is left are only fragments 
        of truth." <br>

        have bought the British line that Sands and the other dissidents aren't 
        worth talking to. We have been forgetful. It was only a little more than 
        two centuries ago that dissidents in the American colonies joined as a 
        revolutionary force to overthrow the British presence." <br>

      <p><a name="buckley01"></a>"What is proved by the death of Bobby Sands? 
        That there are men in Ireland willing to die in the cause of national 
        unity. But we knew this already. Hundreds, on both sides, have been killed, 
        and have killed, to further their political objectives. To offer to die 
        for one's cause, however, is not the equivalent of a) ennobling that cause; 
        or b) furthering it." <br>

      <p><a name="nyhan01"></a>"Since Sands' death, the world has been turning 
        its attention elsewhere. The Pope got shot, war may break out any day 
        in the Mideast, and Belfast has not blown up in the kind of civil strife 
        some had predicted. If Thatcher's gamble was to ride out the first couple 
        of hunger-strike deaths and respond with massive security patrols, then 
        she has won her gamble." <br>

      <p><a name="mccarthy02"></a>"Throughout the fast of Bobby Sands, the member 
        of Parliament-elect now dead of terminal patriotism and mourned by his 
        people as a hero, British leaders never failed to define him as a convicted 
        terrorist. We were asked to believe that he was a low-life Paddy, destructive 
        to the peace that the brave British Army was valiantly trying to keep. 
      </p>
      <p>But what if the definition of Sands is enlarged, as it should be, and 
        we include not only the offenses he is alleged to have committed but also 
        the government-sanctioned violence against Northern Ireland's Catholic 
        minority from which Sands and so many other young men like him emerged? 
        The picture then, as would be expected, is much different." <br>

        in Northern Ireland. It may seem so at first, upon the evidence of headlines 
        and television images. There may be death, brutal senseless deaths, and 
        violent demonstrations, more violent and more widespread perhaps than 
        any in recent years, but after a while, after a few weeks, the province 
        will sink back into its apparent hopelessness." <br>

      <p><a name="tyrrell01"></a>"Above all else, to be Irish is to be Catholic: 
        genuflecting, chest-pounding, church-going Catholic. The devout Catholicism 
        of the Irish people is a phenomenon to move the stoutest skeptic, even 
        when he is full of Guinness and song in the Dublin night. Under cruel 
        English occupation the Irish fought for their religion. They suffered 
        grim privation because of it. And today, they observe it fervently in 
        their polity and in their churches. </p>
      <p>Life in Ireland is Catholic. When the pope's emissary, Msgr. John Magee, 
        visited Bobby Sands and his fellow IRA terrorists, he reiterated the obvious 
        - the church disapproves of suicide. Had Bobby Sands been an Irish patriot 
        rather than a terrorist and friend of the PLO, he would have followed 
        the moral strictures of his church." <br>

        [Road in Belfast] will read 'Remember Bobby Sands.' Sands will in that 
        way enter history, his anguish translated into a slogan on those walls 
        which are the textbooks of Northern Ireland. But in a sense - in [James] 
        Joyce's sense - he was in history from the moment he began his fast. His 
        supporters have been reminding us of the Irish tradition of such martyrdom, 
        evoking history as a context for his deed…</p>
      <p> Perhaps, being Irish, such things are central to their sense of identity. 
        Britain has served them ill, and perhaps herself as well, by conspiring 
        with the IRA to bestow upon them so ambiguous an icon as the body of Bobby 
        Sands." <br>

        once again the curious romantic mist that obscures some people's vision 
        when they consider the Irish Republican Army. The Massachusetts House 
        passed a resolution honoring Sands. Others treated his self-imposed death 
        as a tragedy akin, say, to the untimely loss of a war poet. </p>
      <p>Both were about as poetic as the characters in the old gangster movies. 
        They had long records of criminal violence. Ah but the glorious cause, 
        the sympathizer will say. Some glory. Some cause."<br>

      <p><a name="holland01"></a>"Sands' election to the House of Commons on April 
        10 opened up certain possibilities for the British Government had they 
        wanted to take advantage of them. After he became Robert Sands MP, the 
        British no longer need have considered him as an isolated "extremist"-one 
        with whom it would have been embarrassing to have to deal; no-he was a 
        man with a constituency, and that constituency should have been recognized 
        by the authorities. </p>
      <p>In a way, it would have let Thatcher off the hook. Often the government 
        has said to the paramilitaries "use the ballot box, then we can consider 
        your views." This is precisely what Sands did. He gave the government 
        the opportunity it had frequently claimed it wanted. And what was the 
        result? The government ignored the result of the very process it for so 
        long had been extolling. </p>
      <p>By so doing it has probably only succeeded in confirming the Provisional 
        IRA's commitment to violence. </p>
      <p>As the other hunger strikers continue to deteriorate, Thatcher continues 
        to parrot the extraordinarily hypocritical line: 'A crime is a crime is 
        a crime.' This is not so, and the government knows it. Apart from the 
        notorious failure of the authorities to apply that doctrine to their won 
        security forces, as well as to a certain member of Thatcher's cabinet 
        responsible for sanctioning illegal acts in 1971 it does not take into 
        account the precedents which exist in English prison rules and practices."

        Hughes last Friday as other Catholics go to London. The English called 
        him a terrorist and a suicide artist, but to these people he was a war 
        hero and a saint… </p>
      <p>From every direction rivers of people poured down the roads toward the

      <p><a name="kelly01"></a>"'Perfidy' is the only word to describe the attitude 
        of all British parties towards the H-Block hunger strikers...<span class="title"> 
        </span> </p>
      <p>The propaganda war will rage as well. 'A crime is a crime' Margaret Thatcher 
        will say as the MPs drone, 'hear, hear.' The hunger strikers will be described 
        as 'murderers,' 'terrorists,' 'criminals!' </p>
      <p>I did not know Frank Hughes. I may not agree with the violence he practiced. 
        But I understand it. The British, and indeed many southerners do not. 
        They have little experience of the gruesome statelet called "Northern 
        Ireland," the political slum of Europe. They cannot possibly understand 
        how one can endure so much." <br>

      <p><a name="mcgrory01"></a>"The funeral of Patsy O'Hara, a 23-year-old weaver 
        and the latest of the hunger strikers to die, took place while a theological 
        dispute was raging over whether he and his three comrades had committed 
        suicide. </p>
      <p>During the funeral, the orations the brother of the deceased gave a talk 
        that was the moral equivalent of Paisley's diatribe. </p>
      <p>John O'Hara, anxious to make the event a political occasion and an IRA 
        recruiting rally, was enjoying the celebrity of the moment. He read from 
        a single-spaced, three-page screed a harrowing account of O'Hara's final 
        hours." <br>
