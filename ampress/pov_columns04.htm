      <p>"In three months, Mrs. Thatcher has done more to advance the cause of 
        the IRA than the IRA has ever managed on its own behalf. Its response 
        to her inflexibility - a conveyor belt of death churning out the bodies 
        of the eager dead with what has almost come to be monotonous regularity 
        - has altered both the nature and the context of the situation. It has 
        allowed the IRA to usurp the moral high ground. </p>
      <p>First, the string of deaths has gone a long way toward humanizing the 
        IRA…Second, the deaths have allowed the IRA to reestablish itself in the 
        heroic mold and to reaffirm its legitimacy in a historical context…Third, 
        the deaths have allowed the IRA to redefine the conflict on its own terms…Fourth, 
        the deaths have slowly become the catalyst for unleashing the latent anti-British 
        sentiments that lurk just below the surface of the Irish national psyche.</p>
      <p> In Ireland the center is in danger of collapsing. The voices of moderation 
        are mute. Madness has taken hold. The frenzies bewilder. In the words 
        of Yeats, 'monstrous familiar images swim to the mind's eye.' They are 
        blackmailing us, relentlessly, ruthlessly, perhaps even lovingly, and 
        Mrs. Thatcher, may God forgive her, is their bagman." <br>
        <span class="title">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Martyrdom works for 
        the IRA" by Padraig O'Malley <br>

        1981, 1-23-4-C </span></p>
      <p>"The IRA is a terrorist organization, which, in its battle to unite Ulster 
        with the Irish Republic, has killed Catholic and Protestant, soldier and 
        civilian alike. The IRA deserves no sympathy. In the negotiations held 
        by the Roman Catholic Churches' Irish Commission for Justice and Peace 
        last month, both sides made large concessions in their demands and seemed 
        to be making real progress toward accommodation. Once again, the IRA's 
        tactics have succeeded in blocking an agreement. The stiff, rather unimaginative 
        response by the British authorities has not been helpful either. </p>
      <p>Hunger strikes and the violence they have spawned are not a valid reason 
        to delay serious negotiations toward a solution to the tragedy in Northern 
        Ireland. Such a solution cannot, as Protestant leaders wish, continue 
        the present system of discrimination against the Ulster Catholics. Nor 
        can it reflect the IRA's wish of uniting the North with the Republic of 
        Ireland against the wishes of the Protestants, who are the majority of 
        Northern Ireland's people." <br>

        as the world's press congregated for an event that rates more exposure 
        worldwide than a Presidential inauguration or a papal election, the last 
        hours of those two young lives were ebbing away. </p>
      <p>The two events occur within a few days of each other, the deaths and 
        the wedding. Never could the most insane philosopher devise such a theoretical 
        model to show the essential division between two neighboring islands, 
        nations which should be more closely united in the interests of both but 
        which instead seem destined to be pulled further apart by events which 
        only one really has the power to alter." <br>
        <span class="title">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One nation's wedding 
        and another's funerals" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by John A. Kelly<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Irish Echo,</i> 8 August 1981, 
        2 </span></p>
      <p><a name="holland01"></a>"Owen Carron's recent election to the Westminister 
        constituency left vacant by the death of Bobby Sands has confirmed a dramatic 
        shift in popular sympathy towards the Provisional IRA and other militant 
        republican organizations. The shift, which is mainly due to the hunger-strike 
        and how the British have handled-or mishandled-it, has established militant 
        republicans as politically credible. </p>
      <p>The fact that the hunger-strikers have shown themselves prepared to die, 
        under horrible circumstances, has given the republicans a moral credibility 
        that has already been translated into political support. By voting for 
        Sands (although not because he was an IRA man) the Catholics of Fermanagh 
        and South Tyrone showed that they recognized the sacrifice he was making, 
        and the cause for which he made it, as being above the tactics used by 
        his organization. </p>
      <p>In the end, however, the organization itself benefits inevitably when 
        its members demonstrate such determination and courage. This shows up 
        in votes." <br>

      <p> <a name="campbell01"></a>"The hunger strike is over and now Mrs. Thatcher 
        will grant many of the concessions she refused to grant to the strikers 
        when some of them were dying. Her minion in Ireland, James Prior, boasts 
        about sticking to principles, and says that now the strikers have been 
        "defeated" that he will talk about making some changes. </p>
      <p>The British Government's behavior now is typical of British behavior 
        over the centuries - always making concessions when it was too late to 
        gain them any good will in Ireland. Always too little and too late. Does 
        Maggie Thatcher really think that even if she gave in now to all five 
        demands that this would do anything to lessen the ferocious hatred the 
        Catholic community in the North has for her? She is a fool if she does. 
      </p>
      <p>Instead of boasting about principles and about defeats, the British would 
        do well to think about leaving Ulster. Otherwise they may very well learn 
        the real meaning of defeat and be forced to go, principles or no principles."<br>

        17</span></p>
      <p> <a name="bank01"></a>"During the seven months of the hunger strike, 
        10 Provisional IRA prisoners died; 64 people were killed outside Maze 
        Prison in strife-related incidents. These tragedies sparked renewed violence 
        in Northern Ireland. Americans struggling to piece together the picture 
        need to see the strife-torn country from several different perspectives 
        and to realize that the issues come in shades of gray." <br>
