      <p>&quot;And in Northern Ireland all parties agree that American sympathy 
        and support is the single victory most devoutly to be wished in a propaganda 
        war.</p>
      <p>Americans generally receive high marks for their professionalism, energy 
        and courage, and yet it's clear (especially to the U.S. reporters themselves) 
        that the strife in Northern Ireland is being conveyed to the American 
        public in only the most skeletal and simple-minded terms; that the war's 
        roots in the ancient hostility between native Gaels and the colonizers 
        imposed upon them by Great Britain hundreds of years ago are rarely explicated 
        in news broadcasts or even documentaries; and that television's too-quick 
        use of such shorthand phrases as 'sectarian violence' has persuaded many 
        Americans that the conflict is purely a theological war between Catholics 
        and Protestants on some obscure doctrinal issue when, in truth, it has 
        an agonizingly complex history in the cultural, tribal, racial, ethnic, 
        temperamental and social differences of the 1.5 million people of that 
        embattled province...</p>
      <p> Another Republican tactic is to export relatives of hunger strikers 
        to the United States for appearances on network-television and local-station 
        news and talk shows, where they are often greeted as celebrities. Cries 
        of 'exploitation' erupted in Britain recently when the 10-year-old daughter 
        of hunger striker Joseph McDonnell was interviewed on <i>Good Morning 
        America</i> show. Local TV stations, especially in cities with large Irish-American 
        populations (New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia) have been receptive 
        to these touring relatives, a factor that moves David Gilliland to complain 
        that 'some TV stations in the United States are platforms for the Republican 
        cause.'</p>
      <p>Thus, the British are certain that local TV reporting in Boston is what 
        prompted the Massachusetts House of Representatives recently to adopt 
        a resolution demanding the withdrawal of the British consul from Boston 
        and urging President Reagan to 'consider imposing political and economic 
        sanctions against the Empire of Great Britain.' Such resolutions (and 
        there have been others) leave the British in exasperation and despair 
        over the failure of their own spokesmen-with their cultivated British 
        accents and reasonable tones-to counteract the almost invincible perception 
        in the United States that Northern Catholics are the downtrodden underdogs 
        struggling to free themselves from the same oppressors whom Americans 
        vanquished so satisfyingly in 1781." <br>

        "The current issue of TV Guide…this week bears as its cover story 'The 
        Battle for Northern Ireland-How TV Tips the Balance.' Several aspects 
        of the article more than merit our attention. For the article (while not 
        one-sidely favorable) details not only the means both subtle and blunt 
        by which our news of Ireland had been distorted and censored prior to 
        the hunger strike breakthrough, but also provides direct admission by 
        no less an authority than the British government's chief propaganda officer 
        in the north about the tremendous impact of the American hunger strike 
        support campaign against the British." <br>

      <p>"Far from discrediting our cause, British intransigence, which created 
        the hunger strike, has given us international political recognition, and 
        has made the cause of Irish freedom an international issue, has increased 
        support at home and abroad for Irish resistance, and has shown that the 
        oppressed nationalist people and the political prisoners are one." <br>

      <p>"When hunger striker Bobby Sands died, Northern Ireland seemed ready 
        to tear itself apart. </p>
      <p>Murder and mayhem ran through the streets and attracted the world's press. 
        At one point, ABC News had seven television camera crews in Northern Ireland. 
        Sympathy for the hunger strikers reached record levels in Ulster, In the 
        Irish Republic, and in the United States… </p>
      <p>Yet, with each succeeding death, the violent response was a little less, 
        the news coverage less, and sympathy less." <br>

      <p>"Certainly - as far as men and women of good will are concerned - the 
        end of the hunger strike in the H-Blocks of the Maze Prison is welcome 
        news. Arguments as to who won or lost the macabre confrontation are immaterial. 
      </p>
      <p>The ten men who died put their own lives on the line - no one else's. 
        What they achieved was that the spotlight of the world press was put on 
        the North. Never before was world opinion so galvanized against British 
        policy in the North of Ireland."<br>

      <p>&quot;British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher last week attacked Irish 
        Northern Aid by name. The attack was followed by a highly unusual front 
        page editorial in the London<i> Daily Express</i>, which attacked Mayor 
        Koch of New York, and the Four Horsemen of Irish-American politics, Hugh 
        Carey, Edward Kennedy, Daniel Moynihan and Thomas O'Neill, as well as 
        Irish Northern Aid. The attacks were received by Irish Northern Aid both 
        as an indication of the committee's impact upon the British and as an 
        unanticipated source of further publicity and financial support.&quot;

      <p>"The Irish bishops denounced the hunger strike, while Irish priests buried 
        the hunger-strikers. (Sixty priests attended the funeral of Raymond McCreesh.) 
        American Catholics saw the funerals on TV followed by the paramilitary 
        rites of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA)-the coffin draped 
        in the tricolor Irish flag, masked men in uniform firing shots over the 
        dead soldier. Rallies in support of the hunger-strikers in New York and 
        Washington, D.C., included priests celebrating Mass for crowds that frequently 
        broke into the chant 'IRA: All the way.' The press only added to the confusion."<br>

      <p>"It appears that, far from being a peripheral issue playing to the media, 
        as suspected a few months ago, the seven-month-long hunger strike at Maze
