        here, in this land, have no deeper wish than that by the next St. Patrick's 
        Day, if not before, the conflict and violence in North Ireland will have 
        been replaced with reason and good will." </p>
      <p>These were the words with which President Ronald Reagan toasted the Irish 
        Ambassador to the United States on 17 March 1981. Little did he nor most 
        Americans realize that a hunger strike - already in its second week - 
        would shatter all semblance of "reason and good will" on both sides of 
        the Atlantic for the remainder of that year.</p>
      <p> In the Maze Prison (formerly Long Kesh) at Lisburn, Co. Antrim, Northern 
        Ireland, twenty-three Irish nationalists participated in a hunger strike 
        to press for political legitimacy within the British penal system. <a href="bio01.htm" class="inpagelink">Ten 
        of these men</a> would die of starvation before the strike ended in October. 
      </p>
      <p>Media reports made these extremely public and controversial deaths, the 
        latest battle in a propaganda war involving the British government and 
        Irish nationalists in Northern Ireland that had been escalating since 
        1969. In this struggle, the sympathy of the American public was an important 
        prize. </p>
      <p><i>The 1981 Hunger Strikes: America Reacts</i> traces the evolution of 
        public opinion in the United States from before the strikes - when few 
        outside the Irish American community knew what the issues were in Northern 
        Ireland - to their conclusion when public awareness was at its height. 
        It also examines the degree to which the American media and the Irish 
        American public gave the hunger strikers the legitimacy they needed to 
        press their cause in Washington and London. The purpose of the exhibit 
        is twofold. First, to present a body of new primary resources and, second, 
        to inspire reflection on the very nature of public opinion making. There 
        are four main sections: </p>
      <p> 
      <ul>
        <li><b>American Press</b> documents the various editorial points of view 
          published in the United States about the 1981 Hunger Strikes, as well 
          as insightful contemporary commentary on the media's role. Also included 
          are the opinions of the principal players in hunger strike politics 
          as reported by American newspaper journalists. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b> Support & Protests</b> chronicles media coverage of Irish American 
          grassroots action in response to the 1981 Hunger Strikes, including 
          street demonstrations and boycotts, as well as official statements issued 
          by American politicians. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Commemoration</b> illustrates how the anniversaries of the 1981 
          Hunger Strikes have been marked in the United States over the past two 
          decades. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> A <b>Timeline</b> follows the hunger strikes publicity trajectory 
          during the first ten months of 1981 by reproducing headlines from the 
          mainstream and ethnic press in the United States.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the <a href="other_res01.htm" class="inpagelink">retrospective attention</a> 
        paid to the 1981 Hunger Strikes, the American dimension is noticeably 
        absent. But twenty years ago, the British government was facing a battle 
        on two fronts. In the Maze, it was a test of wills with Irish Republican 
        Army and Irish National Liberation Army prisoners which has been well 
        documented. In the United States, it was a serious scramble for damage 
        control as media coverage challenged the carefully constructed British 
        image. Ultimately, it was this important American public relations dimension 
        that set the 1981 Hunger Strikes apart from those that Irish nationalists 
        had undertaken in the past. The autumn 1980 strikes did not garner the 
        same headlines that filled American newspapers the following spring and 
        summer. Why? The death of ten men is only a partial answer.</p>
      <p> In the United States the 1980 census had recorded a figure of 44 million 
        Americans claiming Irish ancestry. But in fact the active Irish American 
        community was much smaller. At its core were 200,000 Irish-born residents, 
        just over half of whom resided in <a href="census01.htm" class="inpagelink">five 
        key metropolitan areas:</a> Boston, Chicago, San Francisco-Oakland, Washington, 
        D.C. and vicinity, and New York City-Long Island. These were the very 
        same cities publishing the <a href="news_circ01.htm" class="inpagelink">major 
        organs of American public opinion:</a> <i>The New York Times, The Washington 
        Post, The Chicago Tribune, The Boston Globe, </i>and<i> The San Francisco 
        Chronicle.</i> In addition, New York City published <i>the Daily News</i> 
        (with nearly double the circulation of the Times) and four Irish American 
        weeklies: <i>the Irish Echo, the Irish Advocate, the Irish World, </i>and<i> 
        the Irish People</i>. All of these newspapers are represented in this 
        exhibit, as are some key periodical articles from <i>Time, Life, TV Guide, 
        St. Anthony's Messanger,</i> and the <i>New York Times Magazine.</i> </p>
      <p>New York City bears some further comment because, alone of these five 
        American metropolises, it played the most significant role in the 1981 
        Hunger Strikes. The headquarters of the United Nations and of the British 
        Information Service were located there, as was one of America's premiere 
        performing arts centers. The eyes of the world looked to New York City 
        every week for some reason or other. There were 650,000 people there who 
        had claimed Irish ancestry in the 1980 census and more than a third of 
        all Irish-born people in the United States were living within the Greater 
        New York area. Of these latter, most had emigrated after Ireland was divided 
        into North and South in 1922, and thus, in the local ethnic scene, there 
        was always a dynamic mix of the social and political. During the 1981 
        Hunger Strikes much of the grassroots response came from this segment 
        of the City's population. </p>

      <p>These Irish Americans belied the stereotype of the ignorant but sentimental 
        supporter of Irish nationalism. Many were extremely well informed about 
        critical aspects of the situation in Northern Ireland and they were aware 
        of how politics and the media worked in the American context. Their actions 
        were the antithesis of what journalist Padraig O'Malley describes as a 
        "passivity" that enveloped Ireland, north and south, in 1981. <i>The 1981 
        Hunger Strikes: America Reacts</i> is unique in that it makes available 
        resources that only exist in the United States to tell this other side 
        of the story: the excellent photojournalism of Peter Dolan, the trenchant 
        art of Brian Mór O'Baoigill, the advertisements and flyers of Irish Northern 
        Aid, and the reporting of the Irish People, a thirty-year-old republican 
        newspaper that has never been microfilmed. </p>
      <p>This archival material is balanced by examples of every ideological stripe, 
        ranging from the political analysis of columnists to the opinions of letter-to-the-editor 
        writers, and from the perspective of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 
        to that of hunger striker Bobby Sands. Throughout the debate being aired 
        in the pages of the American press during the 1981 Hunger Strikes two 
        distinct vocabularies emerge that illustrate the enormous power of words 
        in this struggle for public sympathy: patriot vs. terrorist, activist 
        vs. criminal, martyr vs. suicide artist. The way in which Americans viewed 
        the entire situation in Northern Ireland was dramatically influenced as 
        a result. </p>
      <p>Using nearly 200 direct quotations from the American print media as well 
        as approximately 50 images drawn from archival material produced by the 
        Irish American community, <i>The 1981 Hunger Strikes: America Reacts</i> 
        intentionally allows viewers to reach their own conclusions from this 
        point on in the website. </p>
