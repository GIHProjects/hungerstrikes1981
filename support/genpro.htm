        demonstrated outside the British consulate in New York yesterday in a

        of a British Airways office on Fifth Avenue before moving to St. Patrick's 
        Cathedral for a prayer vigil. Outside the cathedral, with fists raised, 
        the crowd sang, "A Nation Once Again," a song favored by supporters of 
        a unified Ireland, before praying in silence and listening to the Rev. 
        Daniel Berrigan, who tried unsuccessfully to visit Mr. Sands." <br>

        a demonstration in front of the British Consulate in support of Bobby 
        Sands and his fellow hunger strikers and to raise funds to counter what 
        they termed 'the pro-British biased shown by some sections of the communications

      <p>'We are pleased with the turnout here and across the country.' [Martin] 
        Galvin, [official spokesman for Noraid] said. 'There are large demonstrations 
        in San Francisco, Philadelphia and Boston. Margaret Thatcher has succeeded 
        in uniting the Irish in America behind the hunger strikers and against 
        what her rule represents.'… </p>
      <p>Outside the British Consulate in New York the demonstrators were vociferous, 
        but orderly. There was anger in their voices, mixed with a sense of "urgency," 
        as chant leaders shouted "Bobby Sands," "Patsy O'Hara," "Frankie Hughes," 
        "Ray McCreesh," the names of the hunger strikers, into a sound system. 
        The marchers responded "Must not die" in cadence…</p>
      <p>An English flag and a mannequin representing Margaret Thatcher of Britain, 
        with a sign reading, "Monster Thatcher Wanted for Murder of Irish People" 
        hung on it, were burned by the demonstrators…</p>
      <p> As the final act of the protest march, the crowd, many of them kneeling, 
        prayed together on Hammerskold Plaza. Only the flapping of the American 
        and Irish flags in the breeze disturbed the voices saying the rosary.

        the shading trees at Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, a stone's throw from the 
        United Nations, to listen to labor organizers and political leaders, including 
        New York City's Mayor Edward I. Koch, univocally denounced the continued

      <p>"British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher last week attacked Irish Northern 
        Aid by name. The attack was followed by a highly unusual front page editorial 
        in the London <i>Daily Express</i>, which attacked Mayor Koch of New York, 
        and the Four Horsemen of Irish-American politics, Hugh Carey, Edward Kennedy, 
        Daniel Moynihan and Thomas O'Neill, as well as Irish Northern Aid. The 
        attacks were received by Irish Northern Aid both as an indication of the 
        committee's impact upon the British and as an unanticipated source of 
        further publicity and financial support." <br>

        Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher have exerted intense pressure to divert 
        this presidential visit towards a different and more sinister end. It 
        is their hope, and their plan, to manipulate our president into assuming 
        the role of British propagandist by attacking the dependents of Irish 
        political prisoners through an attack on Irish Northern Aid." <br>
